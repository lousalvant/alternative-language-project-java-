For this project, I decided to choose Java because of its support for object-oriented programming, extensive libraries, and broad community backing. Java is proficient in handling file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms, unit testing, and exception handling. File ingestion is achieved by using classes like File, FileReader, and BufferedReader, while conditional statements utilize if-else, switch-case, and ternary operators. Assignment statements are straightforward, and loops such as for, while, and do-while provide robust iteration capabilities. Methods or functions are declared using a familiar syntax. Java developers commonly use the JUnit framework, which offers annotations to identify test methods and assertions to verify expected outcomes. Exception handling in Java is facilitated through try-catch blocks, enabling error handling.  

Three libraries I used were JUnit, BufferedReader, and HashMap. JUnit, as mentioned earlier, is a testing framework that offers robust solutions for unit testing for Java applications. BufferedReader reads text from character-input streams, crucial for file handling. HashMap is used for storing key-value pairs and facilitating calculations like counting occurrences and averages. I chose these libraries for their reliability, performance, and widespread usage in the Java ecosystem, ensuring powerful solutions for testing, file handling, and data storage. 

According to my code’s output, the company with the highest average weight is Icemobile. There weren’t any phones that were announced in one year and released in another. There were 948 phones with only one feature sensor. The year with the most phone launches after 1999 is 2019.
